## Where I work

-

### Intersection
*(A Google-backed company)*

![LinkNYC](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/linknyc.jpg?w=730&crop=1)

-

At **Intersection**, we are working towards developing the "smart" cities of tomorrow.

-

### LinkNYC

The **LinkNYC** kiosks bring real-time information such as **subway status** and **weather** to our street corners while also providing **free, fast wifi** and **phone charging/internet**.

### Subway Info Kiosks

We also maintain the digital subway screens you see both in NYC and in transit systems around the country (ie: Chicago, Philly, LA, SF)

-

At **Intersection**, we are working to bridge the gap between "meatspace" (or, IRL...or, "real" world) and "cyberspace" (or, the digital world powered by the internet) to make urban living more connected and useful.

## What I do

-

I am a **senior software engineer** at **Intersection**. I am working on exciting new software that will run on the Links sometime this summer. As a **senior** engineer, I also help out my coworkers when they are stuck on problems.

-

I have most likely helped build or troubleshoot at least **some** of the content you see on the Link screens!

-

### Seen this?

I helped my friend/coworker Ben with writing the code that displays nearby theater times on this screen.

-

###  A Day in the Life

I get into the office and usually look at dashboards (graphs) that summarize the health of our system (ie: are the links broken? is the content showing correctly?)

-

If we see something broken, I look at our code to understand _why_ and push a fix.

-


Around 11AM, we have a "standup" meeting where we briefly discuss what we are working on as a team

-

For the rest of the day, I am writing code or fixing broken code or helping a coworker write/fix code. 

Primarily, I work on software that determines what, how and where advertising content shows up on the Link screens. Most of the code I write runs _behind_ the scenes of the Links, not _on_ it.

## Software Engineering

### Anyone here ever solve a problem...?

-


Engineering, and _software_ engineering, is the **art of problem solving**. 

-

As a software engineer, we write **code** to come up with solutions to problems we see in the real world.

-

**CODE** is basically common speak (or, *colloquialism*) for languages that are used to communicated solely with computers. 

Just like one may learn to speak spanish or french, we can learn a **coding language** to communicate with a machine.

-

There are a bunch of different types of programming languages, just like there are many different *actual* languages:

* Javascript
* Python
* Swift
* Java

-

Knowing how to code is very cool - it's as close as we can get today to being a *wizard* in modern times.

-

For example, I'm always worried about whether or not I locked my front door...so I built this to help me remember:

-

Or, since it's now Ramadan, I built an **[app](https://mottaquikarim.github.io/Ramadan2018/)** to tell me when to start/stop fasting:

-

Final example: hooking up our vacuum clean with Alexa..

## Becoming a Software Engineer

-

To become a software engineer you should...

* Build stuff. I write code every. single. day. For fun!

As far as schooling goes, while it's important to go to college if possible (it helps) it is *not* necessary. 

-

Misconception: you have to be good at math to be a software engineer

-

Misconception: only boys make good software engineers.

**NOT TRUE**!!! Some of the best, smartest software engineers are women! 

-

How to start coding:

* Try **[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)**
